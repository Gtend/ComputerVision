## Task

the summary of computer vison task

| Task | Support     | Description |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [Classification](task/classification) | Base | Image Classification is a supervised machine learning technique to learn and predict the category of a given image. |
| [Similarity](task/similarity)  | Base | Image Similarity is a way to compute a similarity score given a pair of images. Given an image, it allows you to identify the most similar image in a given dataset.  |
| [Detection](task/detection) | Base | Object Detection is a technique that allows you to detect the bounding box of an object within an image. |
| [Keypoints](task/keypoints) | Base | Keypoint detection can be used to detect specific points on an object. A pre-trained model is provided to detect body joints for human pose estimation. |
| [Segmentation](task/segmentation) | Base | Image Segmentation assigns a category to each pixel in an image. |
| [Action recognition](task/action_recognition) | Base | Action recognition to identify in video/webcam footage what actions are performed (e.g. "running", "opening a bottle") and at what respective start/end times. We also implemented the i3d implementation of action recognition that can be found under (contrib)[contrib]. |
| [Tracking](task/tracking) | Base | Tracking allows to detect and track multiple objects in a video sequence over time. |
| [Crowd counting](contrib/crowd_counting) | Contrib | Counting the number of people in low-crowd-density (e.g. less than 10 people) and high-crowd-density (e.g. thousands of people) scenarios.|
